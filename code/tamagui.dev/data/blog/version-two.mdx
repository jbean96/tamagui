<IntroParagraph>
  Version two has taken us quite a while. You can call it stability. We definitely wanted a bit too much for a version two, and so delayed it for a while. Instead, we're cutting version 2 sooner than later just to break a few long-deprecated APIs, and to avoid having to write a blog post that is a mile long.
</IntroParagraph>

For new readers, Tamagui is a complete cross-platform styling solution. It has a core styling library, an optional UI kit that can be used unstyled or styled, and a novel optimizing compiler that outputs platform-optimized code, even doing advanced analysis and optimization to flatten VDOM.

Version 2 doesn't make many breaking changes. We had deprecated a number of APIs over the last year and are now making those changes official.

The full list of breaking changes is:

- Move from `tamagui` to `@tamagui/ui`
- Accessibility props - 
- Flex defaults - 
- TypeScript 5 -
- Button - Button moves to a composable component only API (with the old button available still as `OldButton`)
- ListItem - ListItem moves to a composable component only API
- Select - Select inherits from ListItem, so it just inherits the same changes.

A ton has changed since version 1, we've collected all the major changes below.

## @tamagui/core

The core styling library now has no dependency at all outside of React. It's a self-contained 30Kb universal styling library. It implements the React Native View, Text and styling APIs (which are basically a subset of CSS, in Typescript), and expands them to include a lot more of what CSS can do. It feels in practice much like a typed Stitches or Styled Components.

Here are some highlights since version 1:

#### Aligning

#### Container Queries

#### useProps, useStyle, usePropsAndStyle

####

## @tamagui/ui

One of the biggest changes

## Acknowledgements

We've had 38 new contributors since early this year, exponentially increasing! Thanks to all of them, and also to the many QA testers that join in our Discord chat every day :).

Early sponsors have made a huge difference: I owe a large thank you to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Codingscape](https://codingscape.com), [QuestPortal](https://www.questportal.com) and [BeatGig](https://beatgig.com), the first corporate sponsors ❤️.

Tamagui draws inspiration and small areas of code from some incredible other libraries: [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) provided much of the composable component APIs, [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) handles all of the floating elements positioning, [Moti](https://moti.fyi) which served as a start point for the animation drivers, and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the nifty AnimatePresence functionality.
